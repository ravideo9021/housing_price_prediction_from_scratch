## 📌 **Project Title:**  
🏠 **Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression (From Scratch)**  

---

## 🔥 **Project Description**

This project involves building a **Housing Price Prediction Model** using **Linear Regression from scratch**, without relying on pre-built machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn. The model predicts housing prices based on features like:
- **Square Footage**
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Distance from the City Center**
- **Age of the House**

The model is trained using **Gradient Descent** and optimized based on **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the cost function.  
This project is inspired by **Andrew Ng's "Supervised Learning: Regression and Classification" course** on **Coursera**.

## 🚀 **Features and Functionality**
✅ **Data Generation & Normalization:**  
- Synthetic dataset with realistic housing attributes.  
- Normalization applied for better gradient descent convergence.  

✅ **Model Implementation:**  
- **From Scratch:** Linear Regression model built using NumPy without external ML libraries.  
- **Gradient Descent Optimization:** Implements weight updates through gradient descent.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used as the loss function.  

✅ **Visualization:**  
- **Cost Reduction Plot:** Visualizes how the cost decreases over epochs during training.  
- **Prediction Visualization:** Scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted housing prices.  

✅ **Customization Options:**  
- You can easily swap the synthetic dataset with a real-world housing dataset.  
- Adjustable **learning rate**, **epochs**, and **batch sizes**.

## 📊 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core language used for the project.  
- **NumPy**: For matrix operations, weight updates, and cost calculation.  
- **Pandas**: For dataset management and visualization.  
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization (cost reduction and prediction accuracy).
